For example, if you have a large music or photo library or lots of apps, it\u2019s a good idea to consider an iPhone with a larger storage capacity. If you rarely download apps or you don\u2019t take many photos or videos, an iPhone with a smaller capacity may be better for you. When deciding which size to choose, be sure to consider how your storage needs may change over time. Check the storage capacity of your current iPhone and see how much storage you\u2019re using.</p>"
